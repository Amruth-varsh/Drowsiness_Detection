# Drowsiness_Detection
Drowsiness detection systems enhance road safety by addressing driver fatigue. These systems use advanced technologies, such as cameras to track facial features and movements, monitoring parameters like eye closure duration, blink frequency, and head position to detect signs of drowsiness. Some systems also incorporate biometric sensors to monitor heart rate and EEG patterns, providing a comprehensive understanding of the driver's alertness. Machine learning algorithms are crucial, enabling the system to learn from large datasets and improve its accuracy over time, offering personalized alerts. Real-time processing is essential, as the algorithms must quickly analyze data and trigger timely warnings. Common warning methods include auditory alarms, seat vibrations, and visual alerts on the dashboard, prompting drivers to take corrective action, such as taking a break or adjusting their driving behavior.
